    <h1>Arousal</h1>
    </p>
    <img src="img/arousal_mani.png" width="100%">
    <p>
        This scale relates to how <b>awake</b>, <b>stimulated</b>, or <b>stirred up</b> someone is.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        <b>High arousal</b> is when someone has extreme feelings, like excitement or furious anger ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤©.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        <b>Low arousal</b> is closer to sleep, when people are most relaxed, or even bored ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜ª.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        You will rate someone's arousal using the up/down dimension of the reponse grid.
    </p>

    `<p>
    <h1>Pleasantness</h1>
    </p>
â€‹
    <img src="img/valence_mani.png" width="100%">
    
    <p> 
        This scale relates to how <b>pleasurable</b> an emotion is.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        <b>High pleasantness</b> is when someone has very nice, positive feelings like excitement, happiness, and joy ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜€.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        <b>Low pleasantness</b> relates to highly negative emotions like anger or fear ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¨.
    </p>
â€‹
    <p>
        You will rate someone's pleasantness using the left/right dimension of the response grid.

    `<p>The next screen will bring you to the experiment.</p>
    <p>Remember: you must rate the emotions of the audience <b>over time</b> and <b>not statically</b>. A video will have many different emotions contained within it. We are logging how your emotion ratings <b>change over time</b>, and thus are recording the <b>time varying movements of the crosshair</b> and <b>not</b> a singular value, so do not wait until the end of the video to make a rating.</p>
    
    <p>As mentioned, please rate how you think the <b>audience</b> feels. <b>If there is no audience visualization present, rate how you think a hypothetical audience will feel</b>. There is a fair amount of repetition in this experiment, that is normal!</p>`
